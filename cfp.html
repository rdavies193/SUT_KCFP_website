						<h2>Swinburne Keck Call for Proposals 2023A</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Proposal submission deadline is: <strong> 5pm Friday 30th of September 2022 (AEDT) </strong>. All proposals must be emailed to the STACK technical secretary at <a href = "mailto: KeckTS@swin.edu.au">KeckTS@swin.edu.au</a>  as a single pdf following the instructions outlined below by the deadline. 
					</p>
					<p>A total of 6 Keck nights are avilable 2023A (February 1, 2023- July 31, 2023). <br>
						<strong>Keck  I:   2 Dark + 0 Grey + 1 Bright = 3 nights</strong> <br>
   						<strong>Keck II:   2 Dark + 0 Grey + 1 Bright = 3 nights</strong> <br>
					The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval. Any flexibility will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.

						<h2>Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT)</h2>
					</header>
					<p align="justify"> In accordance with the Caltech and Swinburne collaborative agreement for Keck, the COO and SUT Directors have agreed to set aside, between them, 1-2 nights each semester from their Director’s allocation to support highly ranked CIT-SUT collaborative proposals. These proposals should seek to develop new and innovative scientific collaborations esp. those with long term strategic potential to have high scientific impact and/or increase the research capabilities of each organization. The following additional selection criteria will be used for evaluation:
						<menu align="left">
							<li>High-risk high-reward pilot proposals for new science.</li>
					  		<li>Pilot for strategic collaborative projects.</li>
					  		<li>Significant ongoing collaboration potential.</li>
					  		<li>Evidence of existing significant ongoing collaboration.</li>
						</menu></p>

				<p align="justify"> Applicants may use up to 0.5 additional pages in the proposal template to discuss how their proposal meets all or any of these selection criteria. The TACs will make a recommendation on these to the Directors. The final decision on these allocations will be made by the COO and SUT Directors jointly. They reserve the right not to make an allocation if proposals do not reach a high enough bar.
				Please read the <a href="#one">Applicant Policy and Procedures</a> for more details and contact the <a href = "mailto: KeckTS@swin.edu.au">Technical Secretary</a> if you require any further clarifications on the DDT process.</p>

						<h2>Submitting a Proposal</h2>
						<p align="justify"> 
						<ol align="left" type="1">
							<li>1) Check your eligibility in the <a href="#one">Applicant Policy and Procedures</a> document.</li>
					  		<li>2) Check <a href="#one">KECK Instrument Availability</a>.</li>
					  		<li>3) Prepare your proposal application. A single application has two components - an Online Cover Sheet and a Project Outline.</li>
						</ol></p>

						<p align="justify"><a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php" target="blank"><strong>KECK Online Cover Sheet.</strong></a>
						The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available at the above link. You will need to create a Keck user account if you do not already have one. Please make sure to include ALL collaborators on this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne. As part of the cover sheet, observers are instructed to indicate which observing run dates during the semester are preferred (P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable (X) for their programs. It is to the observer's advantage to be as liberal as possible in specifying acceptable dates. A PDF version of the Keck cover sheet is to be sent with the project outline. Using your web browser's print facility, this cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or postscript and converted to pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command. </p>

						 <p align="justify"> <a href="STACK_proposal_2023A.tex" target="blank"><strong>Project Outline.</strong></a>       
						All applicants will need to download the 2023A version of the STACK proposal by clicking the above link. Instructions and page limits are included as comments in the proposal. Additionally, you can use the version in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/yhsxkwcfxywr" target="blank">Overleaf</a>. Use instructions <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Copying_a_project#Making_a_copy_of_a_project" target="blank">here</a> to copy the overleaf project. 
					</p>


					<p align="justify"> 
						<ol align="left" type="1">
							<li>4) Combine the two PDF files into one file. This can be done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a href= https://combinepdf.com target="blank">combinepdfs</a>  or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs. See some other options <a href= https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit/mergePDF.html  target="blank">here</a>. Proposals must use the naming convention: <strong>PIlastname_semesterAB_proposalnumber.pdf </strong>(e.g. Lastname_2023A_W180.pdf) and emailed to the <a href = "mailto: KeckTS@swin.edu.au">STACK Technical Secretary</a>  by the deadline with the email subject heading <strong>PIlastname_semesterAB_proposalnumber</strong>. The Keck proposal number can be found at the top of the Keck Cover Sheet and is issued once you fill out and save an initial version of the Cover Sheet. Await confirmation of receipt by the Technical Secretary. If confirmation not received by midday on the day following the deadline, please contact the Technical Secretary immediately.</li>

					  		<li>5) For PIs that have been awarded time in the past, you will need to describe your outcomes on the <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/keck_pubs/" target="blank">Keck Publication Page</a> .</li>
					  	</ol></p>

					<p align="justify"> <strong> Proposal Outcomes </strong> </br>
						The STACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and in early April to review semester "B" proposals. The STACK then puts forth their recommendations to Caltech. Proposers will learn of the results late-October (semester A) and late-April (semester B). Approved proposals are not confirmed until Keck is able to successfully schedule the time (which is not guaranteed). The Keck telescope schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) and 1 June (semester B).

						<h2>Remote Observing</h2>
						<p align="justify"> Swinburne has the capability to control the instruments and observations at Keck completely remotely from campus (AMDC 912), i.e., mainland-only observation mode.  For remote observing assistance, please contact <a href = "mailto: rdavies@swin.edu.au">Rebecca Davies</a>. Those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities for either fully remote or eavesdropping mode, must contact <a href="https://keckobservatory.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MOSD/pages/111214660/Remote+Observing+Policy" target="blank">Keck's Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and <a href = "mailto: rdavies@swin.edu.au">Rebecca Davies</a>. This must be done 4 weeks in advance of your run for mainland fully remote mode and 2 weeks in advance for mainland eavesdropping mode.</p>
