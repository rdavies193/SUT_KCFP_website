<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Deadline</div> <a 
name="proposal_deadline"></a> <p>All proposals for the 2011A semester must 
be emailed to the STACK technical secretary (Glenn Kacprzak) before 
<strong>September 22nd, 2010, 5:00pm AEST</strong>. 
</p>


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div> <a
name="available_time"></a> <p>We have <strong>8 Keck</strong> nights
available for 2011A (Feb 1 2011 - July 31 2011).  As part of out
agreement with Caltech, it is expected that the STACK nights are to be
spread evenly over both semesters, lunations and both telescopes. We
are expected to be completely balanced after a period of six semesters
(ending with 2011A).  There are <strong>6 Keck I</strong> nights
available with semester and the lunation distribution is 3 bright, 1
grey, 2 dark. Thanks to a trade with NASA we have <strong>2 Keck
II</strong> and the lunation distribution is 1 dark and 1 grey.


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal</div> <a
name="application_procedure"></a>

<p>First check your eligibility in the <a href="procedures.pdf">STACK
policies and Procedures</a> document.</p>

<p>A single application should comprise of two parts: The first part, an 
online cover sheet, has to be submitted to the Keck Observatory and is 
available <a 
href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">here</a> (this 
requires you to create a Keck user account). Please make sure to include 
ALL your collaborators in this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne. 
Using your web browser's print facility this cover sheet can be saved as a 
postscript (and converted to pdf using the ps2pdf command) or PDF file.  
The PDF version of the Keck cover sheet should be sent with the second 
part of the proposal: A PDF outline of the project following the headlines 
given in the pro-forma latex file (available <a 
href="STACK_proposal.tex">here</a>) .  The project outline should be no 
more than 5-pages long (including figures and references) with a minimum 
of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  Colour images are accepted, 
however they should not be so large that the files cannot be emailed.  
The 2 PDF files should be combined into 1 file (using macs this can be 
done using the program <a 
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a> 
or dragging and dropping in preview) with naming convention 
PIsurname_semester_instrument.pdf (e.g. Kacprzak_10A_DEIMOS.pdf) and emailed 
to the STACK technical sectretary.</p>

If the application is for a student's thesis, the importance of the
proposed work in the student's thesis should be described clearly in
the proposal.

<p>Observers are instructed to indicate which observing runs during the 
semester are preferred (P) or acceptable (A) for their programs. It is to 
the observer's advantage to be as liberal as possible in specifying 
acceptable runs.</p>

<p class="main_text_black">Details of Keck instruments available in
2011A are given in the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page. More detailed information about the
various instruments is available in the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS masks
are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p>The schedule will be released early December 2010. As soon as the
schedule is released, applications should be made to the ANSTO
(Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) Access to
Major Research Facilities Program (<a
href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>)
for financial support for your run.</p>


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Collaborative
Caltech Time</div> <p> We also have access to 5 nights a semester
through collaborating with researchers at Caltech.  To access this
time you need to apply to the Caltech TAC with a Caltech member of
staff as PI.  Information relating the preparation of those proposals
can be found <a
href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit/2011A/Call2011A.html">here</a>. Proposals
are due by <strong>17:00 PST Wednesday 29 September 2010</strong>


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping</div>
<br>

For those who wish you use the remote facilities in "eavesdropping"
mode here at Swinburne, you must contact WMKO's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and Glenn Kacprzak in advance of your
run (4 weeks for mainland-only observing, 2 weeks for mainland
eavesdropping mode). Currently, fully-remote observing is not
available at this time. 
<br>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> <p> The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK)
proposes that applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds
should be made by PIs of successful proposals once they have
determined the amount of funding to be available from other sources,
particularly the Faculty Research Committee and AMRFP funds. KOS
applications will be by a simple pro forma (available <a
href="KOSclaim.docx">here</a>) in which the PI will state their
total costs and the other sources of funds they have pursued. KOS
applications should be sent to the STACK technical secretary. The
technical secretary will check the reasons for the request and pass
any queries to the SACK. The SACK will approve all allocations of KOS
funds. The maximum KOS funding allocated to any given proposal will be
$2200. At the end of each calendar year, residual funds in the Keck
support budget for that year may be distributed retrospectively to
that year's Keck users.</p>
