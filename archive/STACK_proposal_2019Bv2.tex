% A proposal consists of a Keck cover sheet and this proposal form.  
% This proposal form describes the requirements and page limits for
% the various sections.  Overall, there is a 3-page maximum for the 
% Scientific Justification section (including texts, figures and references) and 
%1-page maximum for the  Technical Feasibility and Flexibility & Minimum Time sections.  
% Target lists may be attached to the proposal as a separate 
% sheet(s).  There is a 2-page maximum for the sections BACKUP 
% PROGRAM, CONTRACT END, APPLICANTS' ROLES, STUDENT THESIS 
% INVOLVEMENT, OTHER APPLICATIONS, and FUTURE APPLICATIONS.
% The PREVIOUS ALLOCATIONS AND OUTCOMES section is now attached as 
% a separate sheet(s) at the end of the proposal.

% {\it Instructions:} Scientific Justification: {\bf A MAXIMUM OF THREE
% PAGES, including all figures, tables and references may be used.} 
% You may use subheadings of your own choosing to make your text 
% clearer.
% References may be included in-line (e.g.~Salpeter, 1955, ApJ, 121,
% 161) and/or all together in a separate section (maybe under a heading
% "References" like that below) with only citations in the text

% The Scientific Justification should provide a clear explanation of the background, context and motivation for your proposed observations. 
%It should justify the expected outcome(s) and why they are important and timely.

\clearpage           % Page separator - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE!


% *** NOTE: ONE PAGE is to be used for the TECHNICAL JUSTIFICATION,
% *** FLEXIBILITY \& MINIMUM TIME, and TARGET LIST.  Long target lists
% *** can be included as an attached sheet at the end of the
% *** proposal. We recommend using at least 1/2 page for the TECHNICAL
% *** JUSTIFICATION


\noindent{\bf TECHNICAL JUSTIFICATION:}

% INSTRUCTIONS: The STACK cannot grant time that it cannot clearly see
% will result in the proposed science, so this section is crucial.}
% This section should describe the feasibility of your science on Keck;
% it is NOT the place to discuss, e.g. your target selection, or any
% other aspect of scientific justification.  You must *DEMONSTRATE* and
% *JUSTIFY* (not just merely state) why and how your proposed
% observations can be undertaken with Keck.  You may also want to
% justify why your science requires Keck and/or its instruments, and
% not those available on smaller telescopes.
%
% All proposals MUST address the following points in the description:
%
% -  Describe why the chosen instrument is the best choice.
%
% -  Include all relevant instrument setup details (grating angles,
% filters, slit widths, CCD binning etc.).  
%
% -  State the number of requested nights and FULLY JUSTIFY the
% exposure times and overhead calculations for all targets and all
% set-ups/filters.  Including a worked-out example for a "typical
% target" from longer target lists is acceptable (but you must justify
% why the chosen target is "typical").  For a range of targets, include
% the values for extreme cases. 
% 
% ** NOTE: the STACK must be able to reproduce these values without 
%    further assumptions **
%
% -  Detail the visibility of the targets for the requested nights.
% This must include the number of hours the field is above the Nasmyth
% platforms (rising or setting limits imposed by Keck I and Keck II).
% See http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/TelLimits.html for
% details.  Include the amount of time that they are *not* visible (if
% any) and detail the observations and science that will be made during
% this time.
%
% Note that you MUST include a back-up program in the BACKUP PROGRAM 
% section below.  The backup program must address all of the above 
% points, however, they can be to a lower level of detail.
%
% You must also fully *justify* the technical feasibility of any
% possible variations in the instrument, setup parameters etc. in the
% "Flexibility \& Minimum Time" section.


\noindent{\bf FLEXIBILITY \& MINIMUM TIME:} % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE

% INSTRUCTIONS: Flexibility: Describe any aspect of your proposed
% observations which are flexible with respect to, for example,
% lunation, dates, instrument availability, instrument setting,
% distribution of time (e.g. multiple night gaps allowed) etc.  
% Flexibility will aid us in approving and scheduling your proposal.
% 
% Minimum Time: Please also state the minimum amount of time in which 
% you can undertake your science.  Proposers should keep in mind that 
% SUT have a limited number of nights on Keck each semester and those 
% nights must be distributed over each telescope and over 
% bright/grey/dark time `fairly'.  


\clearpage           % Page separator - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE!


% ***  NEW FOR 2019B --- A maximum of 0.5 pages can be used for the justification of DDT here
\noindent{\bf Justification for  Director's Discretionary Time (if applicable) :}  % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE
\\ {\em Applicants may use up to 0.5  page here to discuss how their proposal meets all or any of these DDT proposal selection criteria (details in the CFP).} \\


\bigskip


% *** NOTE: A TOTAL OF UP TO TWO PAGES are allowed for the additional
% *** information below.

\noindent{\bf BACKUP PROGRAM:}     % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE

% INSTRUCTIONS: Describe a backup program that you will undertake if
% prevailing weather conditions at the telescope, including seeing,
% prevent execution of your main program.  Also, if your proposal relies
% on instruments or facilities which are still experimental or regularly
% lose time to technical problems (e.g.~laser guide star adaptive
% optics) then specify your contingency plans.
%
% This section MUST include the science you will obtain with the BACKUP
% PROGRAM(S) and MUST included details as described in TECHNICAL
% JUSTIFICATION for the proposed science (albeit, detailed to a lesser
% extent).

\bigskip

\noindent{\bf CONTRACT END:}    % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE

% INSTRUCTIONS: Permanent staff and staff and postdocs on fixed-term 
% contracts are eligible as PIs.  The previous restriction that 
% contracts must extend a minimum of 12 months beyond the application 
% deadline has been lifted.  However, PIs must clearly state their 
% contract end date.  
% 
% As a reminder, postdocs must have a staff member as a Co-I.  The 
% staff member will be held responsible for the data and outcomes of 
% the observations.

\bigskip

\noindent{\bf APPLICANTS' ROLES:}    % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE

% INSTRUCTIONS: Describe *in detail* the role of the PI and each of the
% CoIs, particularly those not at Swinburne.  Also specify who the
% leading authors on papers arising from this proposal are likely to be.

\bigskip

\noindent{\bf OBSERVING and DATA REDUCTION EXPERIENCE:}  % - DO NOT
                                % EDIT OR REMOVE
\\ {\em We strongly recommend that a local expert is involved if the
  PI doesn't have the relevant observational and data reduction
  experience.} \\


% INSTRUCTIONS: Describe the PIs observing experience and how it relates
% to the proposed instrument.  If a PI is inexperienced with the
% proposed instrument, one must specify how the PI will obtain the
% necessary experience prior to the observing run.  This may occur in
% several ways: (1) CoIs are experienced with the instrument and will
% aid the PI with observations, (2) the PI may arrive in Waimea ahead of
% time to observe others use the instrument and/or discuss the
% instrument with the instrument specialist and/or (3) the PI may
% eavesdrop on other CAS observers using the same, or a similar,
% instrument during the previous semester.

\bigskip

\noindent{\bf STUDENT THESIS INVOLVEMENT:}  % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE
\\ {\em Note that data is not given to the student but remains
  the responsibility of the PI.} \\

% INSTRUCTIONS: If this proposal forms a part of a student CoI's thesis,
% describe the role it plays in their thesis work and how crucial it is
% to the completion of their thesis.

\bigskip




\noindent{\bf OTHER APPLICATIONS:} % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE

% INSTRUCTIONS: Specify the details (including proposal title, time
% requested and/or already awarded, time allocation committee) for this
% project and related projects over the last year and in the coming
% semester which include the PI or any of the CoIs of this proposal.

\bigskip

\noindent{\bf FUTURE APPLICATIONS:} % - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE 

% INSTRUCTIONS: Justify the number of STACK Keck nights required in
% future semesters for the COMPLETION of the project described in this
% proposal.  If no additional nights are requested by the PI, the STACK
% will assume that the project will be complete after the current number
% requested is awarded.  If additional time is requested in the future
% for a completed project this request must be clearly explained (i.e.,
% new targets have been identified by the PI or in the literature) or it
% will be considered negatively in the ranking of the PIs proposals
% (unless awarded time was lost due to weather/instrument failure).

\clearpage

\noindent{\bf TARGET LIST:}

% INSTRUCTIONS: Use the template table to include a full target list.
% If you run out of room for the target list, please attach an
% additional page at the end of the proposal that includes only the
% target list.

% IMPORTANT !!! 

% INSTRUCTIONS:    
%  Although this section is no long required in this pdf form, please DO ADD 
%  your previous Keck allocation and outcome in this database here: 
%                           http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/keck_pubs/table.php
% The STACK is expecting published data
% for completed projects 1.5 years after the final observation date.
% The lack of publications for completed projects will be considered in the
% ranking of the PIs proposals.   The STACK will use this online database for your proposal ranking, 
% so please update your entry within 3 working days of your proposal submission.
