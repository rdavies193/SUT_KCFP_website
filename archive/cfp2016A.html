<p><strong> Submitting a Proposal for Swinburne Keck Time</strong><br> 
Swinburne is now combining the proposal assessment and time allocation process with both ANU and AAL. Proposals for Swinburne Keck time must be submitted to the Austrailian Keck TAC (KTAC). You can find more information about submitting a proposal to KTAC <a href="http://ausgo.aao.gov.au/keck.html">here</a>.
Prior to the KTAC meeting, the SACK will meet to ensure that all proposals for Swinburne time are compliant with Swinburne criteria for use of Keck time. 
Check your eligibility for Swinburne Keck time in the 
<a href="Applicants.pdf">Applicant Policy and Procedure</a> document. Note that students are not allowed to PI programs asking for Swinburne time.  <br><br>

<strong> When will I know the outcome of the proposal?</strong> KTACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and 
in early April to review semester "B" proposals.  The STACK then puts forth 
their recommendations to Caltech.  Proposers will learn of the results 
late-November (semester A) and late-April (semester B).  Approved proposals are not
confirmed until Keck is able to successfully schedule the time (which is not
guaranteed).  The Keck telescope schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) 
and 1 June (semester B).<br><br>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping - 
Fully remote observing is now operational!</div>
<p>Swinburne now has the capability to control the instruments and 
observations at Keck completely remotely from campus (room SA 118), 
i.e., mainland-only observation mode.  Duplicate network connections, a 
backup ISDN line, duplicate (mirrored) computers, and an uninterrupted 
power supply are a few of the features added to ensure trouble-free 
observations.  The fully remote capability complements Swinburne's 
long-standing remote eavesdropping mode.
<br><br>
Those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities for either 
<b>fully remote</b> or <b>eavesdropping</b> mode, must contact Keck's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and David Fisher.  This must be done 4 
weeks in advance of your run for mainland fully remote mode and 2 weeks 
in advance for mainland eavesdropping mode. <br> <br>

<strong>Financial Assistance for Travel to Keck</strong> <br>

The <a href=https://www.aao.gov.au/itso/keck/travel>ITSO travel policy</a>  currently supports 1 inexperienced person (defined as not having used that instrument within the last 2 years) to attend a Keck run. 
SACK will fund 1 person unless ITSO are funding a Swinburne postdoc or a staff member. So SACK will ensure that at least 1 person is funded to attend the run. The normal limit for travel support is $2K per run. Exceptions to any of above can be requested by making a case to the Chair of the SACK, who will normally consult with other SACK members. Feel free to contact the SACK Chair before filling out the Activiti form to discuss the funding of your upcoming Keck run. The travel funding situation is both fluid and has limited funds, and so is subject to change.


<!-- AAL through ITSO has offered to cover the cost of 1 observer to travel to Keck for every Australian program (including those utilizing a Swinburne night). For informations about reimbursement and cost coverage from ITSO, please see the <href="http://ausgo.aao.gov.au/keck.html#travel"> relevant sections of ITSO webpages</a> or email <i>ITSO "at" aao.gov.au</i>.

<!-- ##### OBSOLETE STACK CONTENT ##############-->
<!-- <p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an <b>Online Cover Sheet</b> and a 
<b>Project Outline</b>.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">KECK ONLINE COVER SHEET</a>
<br>
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available
at the above link.  You will need to create a Keck user account if you
do not already have one.  Please make sure to include ALL collaborators
on this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne.  As part of the cover
sheet, observers are instructed to indicate which observing run dates
during the semester are preferred (P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable
(X) for their programs.  It is to the observer's advantage to be as
liberal as possible in specifying acceptable dates.  A PDF version of the
Keck cover sheet is to be sent with the project outline.  Using your web
browser's print facility, this cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or
postscript and converted to pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project Outline</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="STACK_proposal.tex">STACK PROPOSAL FORM</a>
<br>
All applicants will need to download the 2015B version of the STACK proposal
form above.  You will need to read the instructions for each section in the 
latex file (they are commented out as not to appear on the final proposal).<br>  
<b>There have been changes to the instructions for this semester,</b> and the 
overall format of the proposal has been re-ordered.  The full project outline 
should be written in a minimum of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  The 
Scientific Justification section can be up to a total of 3 pages, including 
figures, tables and references.  A single additional page should be used for 
the Technical Justification and Flexibility & Minimum time sections.  Up to 
two additional pages can be used for the remaining sections.  Target lists 
and the sections Previous STACK Allocation Outcomes are to be attached to the 
end of the proposal.  These attached pages do not count toward the total page 
count but cannot include any other information.  Colour images are accepted, 
however the image files should not be so large that the proposals cannot be 
emailed (i.e., proposals should be less than 1MB in total, but exceptions can 
be made).  The project outline must be saved in PDF format. 
<br><br>

<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIusername_semester_proposalnumber.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Fisher_2015B_W123LA.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
tecretary (dfisher@swin.edu.au) by the deadline.  The Keck proposal number 
can be found at the top of the Keck Cover Sheet and is issued once you 
fill out and save an initial version of the Cover Sheet.
<br><br>

<strong>(5) Previous Semester Outcomes</strong> It is very important that PIs describe the outcomes from previous proposals, as this information is now used by the STACK in assesing current proposals. For PIs that have been awarded time in the past, you will
need to describe your outcomes on the Keck Publication Page
<a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/keck_pubs/">here</a>.

</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time</div>
<p> 
In the interests of promoting collaborative research between Swinburne 
and Caltech, collaborations are to jointly apply to both of their 
respective time allocation committees for Keck time for joint projects 
on an approximately equal time basis. If the proposed joint project is 
not supported by both time allocation committees, the proposed project 
will receive zero nights from either so that no party is disadvantaged 
and each time allocation committee has a clear incentive to support 
their scientists when a genuine desire to collaborate exists.
Caltech will include a summary of Collaborative Time allocations so PIs 
can make collaborative allocations informed by the program history.  The 
link to this summary will be provided here after this semester.
<br><br>
Swinburne and Caltech collaborations will need to apply to the STACK 
following the guidelines described on this webpage and directly to the 
Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals need to be sent to Robert Brucato 
(brucato@astro.caltech.edu) and are due by <strong>18:00 PDT, 01 October, 2014</strong>.
</p>

<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<br>
Laser Guide Star (LGS) time is now available for both the KI and KII telescopes.  
<br>
Because half nights of laser science combined with non-laser science are almost as 
resource intensive for Keck as whole LGS nights, proposers are encouraged to match half 
night LGS allocations with other LGS allocations.  The STACK will note that the Keck I 
and Keck II lasers will not be scheduled on the same night unless it is for a program 
doing simultaneous observations on both telescopes and the STACK will take care to 
distribute allocated laser nights across the semester to avoid over-burdening the laser 
support team in any given month. 
<br><br>
<br>

</p>


<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Policy and Procedures</div>
<a name="policies"></a>
<p> Proposal policy and procedures are outlined in these documents.<br>

</p>


<p>The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that 
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by 
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of 
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty 
Research Grant Schemes.  KOS 
funding is now integrated into the T7 travel form.
