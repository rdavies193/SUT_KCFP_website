</p>
<p> Previous semester proposals are located at the bottom of this page.
</p>
<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Keck Observatory Website</div>
<br>
General information about applying for Keck time can be found
<a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/observing/apply.html">here</a>.
This is the Keck website that includes people to contact if you have
questions, forms, observing considerations, and information for Keck
proposals for other institutions.
</p>

<hr />
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div>
<p>
A total of <strong>8 Keck</strong> nights are available for 2015A
(February 1 2015 - July 31 2015).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck &nbsp;I:</strong> &nbsp; <b>5</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>0 dark, 3 grey, 2 bright</b> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck II:</strong> &nbsp; <b>3</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>1 dark, 1 grey, 1 bright</b>
<br><br>
The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is 
mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be 
decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval.  Any flexibility 
will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with 
much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Instrument Availability</div>
<p>
Refer to <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> webpage for details on all available instruments 
for the 2015A semester.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<br>
Laser Guide Star (LGS) time is now available for both the KI and KII telescopes.  
<br>
Because half nights of laser science combined with non-laser science are almost as 
resource intensive for Keck as whole LGS nights, proposers are encouraged to match half 
night LGS allocations with other LGS allocations.  The STACK will note that the Keck I 
and Keck II lasers will not be scheduled on the same night unless it is for a program 
doing simultaneous observations on both telescopes and the STACK will take care to 
distribute allocated laser nights across the semester to avoid over-burdening the laser 
support team in any given month. 
<br><br>
AO Upgrades:  The new near-IR tip/tilt system on Keck I, TRICK, might be available 
in 15A on a shared-risk basis.  However, proposals should not rely on 
its availability.  In addition, the laser launch on Keck II might be switched to the 
new center launch system (CLS), providing the AO system with a smaller laser spot size.
</p>
<hr />

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal</div> <a
name="application_procedure"></a>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Check your eligibility in the 
<a href="Applicants.pdf">Applicant Policy and Procedure</a> document.
</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Check instrument availability and latest 
information.  Details of Keck instruments available in 2014B are given 
on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page.  Instrument specifics and relevant 
proposal information can be found on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS slitmasks
are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an <b>Online Cover Sheet</b> and a 
<b>Project Outline</b>.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">KECK ONLINE COVER SHEET</a>
<br>
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available
at the above link.  You will need to create a Keck user account if you
do not already have one.  Please make sure to include ALL collaborators
on this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne.  As part of the cover
sheet, observers are instructed to indicate which observing run dates
during the semester are preferred (P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable
(X) for their programs.  It is to the observer's advantage to be as
liberal as possible in specifying acceptable dates.  A PDF version of the
Keck cover sheet is to be sent with the project outline.  Using your web
browser's print facility, this cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or
postscript and converted to pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project Outline</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="STACK_proposal.tex">STACK PROPOSAL FORM</a>
<br>
All applicants will need to download the 2015A version of the STACK proposal
form above.  You will need to read the instructions for each section in the 
latex file (they are commented out as not to appear on the final proposal).<br>  
<b>There have been changes to the instructions for this semester,</b> and the 
overall format of the proposal has been re-ordered.  The full project outline 
should be written in a minimum of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  The 
Scientific Justification section can be up to a total of 3 pages, including 
figures, tables and references.  A single additional page should be used for 
the Technical Justification and Flexibility & Minimum time sections.  Up to 
two additional pages can be used for the remaining sections.  Target lists 
and the sections Previous STACK Allocation Outcomes are to be attached to the 
end of the proposal.  These attached pages do not count toward the total page 
count but cannot include any other information.  Colour images are accepted, 
however the image files should not be so large that the proposals cannot be 
emailed (i.e., proposals should be less than 1MB in total, but exceptions can 
be made).  The project outline must be saved in PDF format. 
<br><br>

<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIusername_semester_proposalnumber.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Cooke_2015A_W123LA.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
tecretary (jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au) by the deadline.  The Keck proposal number 
can be found at the top of the Keck Cover Sheet and is issued once you 
fill out and save an initial version of the Cover Sheet.
<br><br>

<strong>(5)</strong> For PIs that have been awarded time in the past, you will
need to describe your outcomes on the Keck Publication Page
<a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/keck_pubs/">here</a>.

</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time</div>
<p> 
In the interests of promoting collaborative research between Swinburne 
and Caltech, collaborations are to jointly apply to both of their 
respective time allocation committees for Keck time for joint projects 
on an approximately equal time basis. If the proposed joint project is 
not supported by both time allocation committees, the proposed project 
will receive zero nights from either so that no party is disadvantaged 
and each time allocation committee has a clear incentive to support 
their scientists when a genuine desire to collaborate exists.
Caltech will include a summary of Collaborative Time allocations so PIs 
can make collaborative allocations informed by the program history.  The 
link to this summary will be provided here after this semester.
<br><br>
Swinburne and Caltech collaborations will need to apply to the STACK 
following the guidelines described on this webpage and directly to the 
Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals need to be sent to Robert Brucato 
(brucato@astro.caltech.edu) and are due by <strong>18:00 PDT, 01 October, 2014</strong>.
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Policy and Procedures</div>
<a name="policies"></a>
<p> Proposal policy and procedures are outlined in these documents.<br>
<img src="http://www.swin.edu.au/images/arrow1.gif" width="14" height="8" alt=""><a href="Applicants.pdf">Applicant Policy and Procedure document for 2015A</a><br>

</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Outcomes</div>
<p> The STACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and 
in early April to review semester "B" proposals.  The STACK then puts forth 
their recommendations to Caltech.  Proposers will learn of the results 
late-October (semester A) and late-April (semester B).  Approved proposals are not
confirmed until Keck is able to successfully schedule the time (which is not
guaranteed).  The Keck telescope schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) 
and 1 June (semester B).
</p>
<hr />

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping - 
Fully remote observing is now operational!</div>
<p>Swinburne now has the capability to control the instruments and 
observations at Keck completely remotely from campus (room SA 118), 
i.e., mainland-only observation mode.  Duplicate network connections, a 
backup ISDN line, duplicate (mirrored) computers, and an uninterrupted 
power supply are a few of the features added to ensure trouble-free 
observations.  The fully remote capability complements Swinburne's 
long-standing remote eavesdropping mode.
<br><br>
Those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities for either 
<b>fully remote</b> or <b>eavesdropping</b> mode, must contact Keck's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and Jeff Cooke.  This must be done 4 
weeks in advance of your run for mainland fully remote mode and 2 weeks 
in advance for mainland eavesdropping mode.
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> 
<p> 

After the Keck schedule is released, applications should be made 
to Swinburne Research for financial support via the Access to Major 
Research Facilities Scheme  
<a href="http://www.research.swinburne.edu.au/grants-contracts/funding/internal-grants/amrfs.html">(AMRFS)</a>.
This scheme was made possible from efforts made by Michael Murphy as FICT ADR.</p>

<p>The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that 
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by 
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of 
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty 
Research Grant Schemes and the above-mentioned AMRFS funds.  KOS 
funding is now integrated into the T7 travel form.
</p>
<p>
Keck users may also apply to the SACK Chair for co-funding to employ 
a vacation student or Research Assistant (level 1) to help accelerate 
the process of publishing their Keck data.  The base case is that the 
SACK will fund half of the cost of a vacation student or RA for 8 weeks 
(in 2014 those costs were $4K/2 and $11K/2).  It is expected that the 
Keck PI (or staff  Co-I) fund the other half.  Variations on the base 
case will also be considered.  There is no application deadline but 
success is subject to funding being available.  The application should 
make the case and give relevant details for using SACK funds within a 
1 page letter or email to the SACK Chair.
