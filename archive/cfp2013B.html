<h1>Call for Keck Proposals 2013B</h1>

<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Deadline</div>
<br>
Proposal submission deadline for the 2013B semester is: 
<strong>17:00 March 20, 2013</strong><br>
All proposals must be emailed to the STACK technical secretary, Jeff Cooke at 
&nbsp;<i>jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au</i>&nbsp; in pdf form (see below) <br> before 
<strong>17:00 AEDT</strong> on the deadline date.

</p>
<p> Previous semester proposals are located at the bottom of this page.
</p>
<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Keck Observatory Website</div>
<br>
General information about applying for Keck time can be found
<a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/observing/apply.html">here</a>.
This is the Keck website that includes people to contact if you have
questions, forms, observing considerations, and information for Keck
proposals for other institutions.
</p>

<hr />
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div>
<p>
A total of <strong>8 Keck</strong> nights are available for 2013B 
(August 1 2013 - January 31 2014).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck &nbsp;I:</strong> &nbsp; <b>4</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>2 dark, 1 grey, 1 bright</b> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck II:</strong> &nbsp; <b>4</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>2 dark, 0 grey, 2 bright</b>
<br><br>
The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is 
mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be 
decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval.  Any flexibility 
will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with 
much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Instrument Availability</div>
<p>
Refer to <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> webpage for details on all available instruments 
for the 2013B semester.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<br>
Laser Guide Star (LGS) time is now available for both the KI and KII telescopes.  
The restriction on the number of available LGS nights has been lifted.  Keck would like 
scientific demand from all institutions to determine both the number of nights and the 
distribution of nights between Keck I and Keck II. 
<br><br>
Because half nights of laser science combined with non-laser science are almost as 
resource intensive for Keck as whole LGS nights, proposers are encouraged to match half 
night LGS allocations with other LGS allocations.  The STACK will note that the Keck I 
and Keck II lasers will not be scheduled on the same night unless it is for a program 
doing simultaneous observations on both telescopes and the STACK will take care to 
distribute allocated laser nights across the semester to avoid over-burdening the laser 
support team in any given month. 
</p>
<hr />

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal</div> <a
name="application_procedure"></a>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Check your eligibility in the 
<a href="procedures.pdf">STACK policies and Procedures</a> document.
</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Check instrument availability and latest 
information.  Details of Keck instruments available in 2013B are given 
on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page.  Instrument specifics and relevant 
proposal information can be found on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS slitmasks
are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an <b>Online Cover Sheet</b> and a 
<b>Project Outline</b>.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">KECK ONLINE COVER SHEET</a>
<br>
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available
at the above link.  You will need to create a Keck user account if you
do not already have one.  Please make sure to include ALL collaborators
on this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne.  As part of the cover
sheet, observers are instructed to indicate which observing run dates
during the semester are preferred (P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable
(X) for their programs.  It is to the observer's advantage to be as
liberal as possible in specifying acceptable dates.  A PDF version of the
Keck cover sheet is to be sent with the project outline.  Using your web
browser's print facility, this cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or
postscript and converted to pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project Outline</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="STACK_proposal.tex">STACK PROPOSAL FORM</a>
<br>
All applicants will need to download the 2013 version of the STACK proposal
form above.  You will need to read the instructions for each section in the 
latex file (they are commented out as not to appear on the final proposal).<br>  
<b>There have been changes to the instructions for this semester,</b> but the 
overall format of the proposal remains the same.  The project outline should 
be no more than 6-pages (including figures and references) with a minimum of 
12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  The Scientific Justification 
section can be up to a total of three pages including all figures, tables 
and references.  A single additional page should be used for the Technical 
Justification and Flexibility & Minimum time sections and for the Target 
list.  Up to two additional pages can be used for the remaining items (and 
long target lists).  Colour images are accepted, however they should not 
be so large that the files cannot be emailed.  The project outline must be 
saved in PDF format. 
<br><br>

<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIsurname_Keckproposalnumber.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Cooke_2013B_W056LA.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
tecretary (jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au) by the deadline.  The Keck proposal number 
can be found at the top of the Keck Cover Sheet and is issued once you 
fill out and save an initial version of the Cover Sheet.
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time</div>
<p> 
In the interests of promoting collaborative research between Swinburne 
and Caltech, collaborations are to jointly apply to both of their 
respective time allocation committees for Keck time for joint projects 
on an approximately equal time basis. If the proposed joint project is 
not supported by both time allocation committees, the proposed project 
will receive zero nights from either so that no party is disadvantaged 
and each time allocation committee has a clear incentive to support 
their scientists when a genuine desire to collaborate exists.
Caltech will include a summary of Collaborative Time allocations so PIs 
can make collaborative allocations informed by the program history.  The 
link to this summary will be provided here after this semester.
<br><br>
Swinburne and Caltech collaborations will need to apply to the STACK 
following the guidelines described on this webpage and directly to the 
Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit/2013B/Call2013B.html">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals are due by <strong>17:00 PDT, 2 April, 2013</strong>.
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Policy and Procedures</div>
<a name="policies"></a>
<p> Proposal policy and procedures are outlined in this document.<br>
<img src="http://www.swin.edu.au/images/arrow1.gif" width="14" height="8" alt=""><a href="procedures.pdf">STACK policies and Procedures</a><br>
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Outcomes</div>
<p> The STACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and 
in early April to review semester "B" proposals.  The STACK then puts forth 
their recommendations to Caltech.  Proposers will learn of the results 
late-October (semester A) and late-April (semester B).  The Keck telescope 
schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) and 1 June (semester B).
</p>
<hr />

<!-- As soon as the schedule is released, applications should be made to the 
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) Access 
to Major Research Facilities Program 
(<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>)
for financial support.
</p>
-->

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping</div>
<p>For those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities in 
"eavesdropping" mode, you must contact WMKO's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and Jeff Cooke in advance of your
run (4 weeks for mainland-only observing, 2 weeks for mainland
eavesdropping mode). Currently, fully-remote (mainland-only) 
observing is not available but may be in the near future. 
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> 
<p> 

<!--
As mentioned above, as soon as the Keck schedule is released, 
applications should be made to the ANSTO 
<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>
for financial support.</p>
-->
<p>The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that 
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by 
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of 
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty 
Research Committee and AMRFP funds. After expenses have been acquitted, 
KOS applications can be submitted using <a href="KOSclaim.docx">this form</a> 
in which the PI will state their total costs and the other sources of 
funds they have pursued. KOS applications should be sent to the STACK 
technical secretary <b> after</b> the expenses have been incurred.  The 
technical secretary will check the reasons for the request and pass any 
queries to the SACK. The SACK will approve all allocations of KOS funds. 
The maximum KOS funding allocated to any given proposal will be $2200. 
At the end of each calendar year, residual funds in the Keck support 
budget for that year may be distributed retrospectively to that year's 
Keck users.
