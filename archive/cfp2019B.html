<h1>Call for Keck Proposals 2019B</h1>

<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Deadline</div>
<br>
Proposal submission deadline for the 2019B semester is: 
<strong>Monday, 17:00, 1st April 2019 (AEDT) </strong><br>
All proposals must be emailed to the STACK technical secretary, Tiantian Yuan at 
&nbsp;<i>tiantianyuan@swin.edu.au</i>&nbsp; in pdf form (see below) <br> before 
<strong>17:00 AEDT</strong> on the deadline date.  <br>
</p>

<strong>The primary role of the Swinburne Time Allocation Committee
for Keck (STACK) is to ensure the maximum
scientific outcomes for Swinburne from time on the Keck telescopes.</strong>
See here  <a href="STACK_May2019.pdf">
STACK P&P </a> for details.
<br>
<p>
General information about applying for Keck time can be found on the Keck Observatory Website 
<a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/observing/apply.html">here</a>.
This is the Keck website that includes people to contact if you have
questions, forms, observing considerations, and information for Keck
proposals for other institutions.
</p>

<hr />
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div>
<p>
A total of <strong>6 Keck</strong> nights are available for 2019B
(August 1, 2019 - January 31, 2020).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck &nbsp;I:</strong> &nbsp; <b>2</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>0 dark, 1 grey, 1 bright</b> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck II:</strong> &nbsp; <b>4</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>1 dark, 1 grey, 2 bright</b>
<br><br>
The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is 
mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be 
decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval.  Any flexibility 
will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with 
much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.
</p>
<br>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT)</div>
</p>
In accordance with the Caltech and Swinburne collaborative agreement for Keck, the COO and SUT Directors have agreed to set aside, between them, 1-2 nights each semester from their Director’s allocation to support highly ranked CIT-SUT collaborative proposals. These proposals should seek to develop new and innovative scientific collaborations esp. those with long term strategic potential to have high scientific impact and/or increase the research capabilities of each organisation. The following additional selection criteria will be used for evaluation:
<br>
</p>
(1) High-risk high-reward pilot proposals for new science <br>
(2) pilot for strategic collaborative project <br>
(3) significant ongoing collaboration potential <br>
(4) evidence of existing significant ongoing collaboration <br>
 </p>
Applicants may use up to 0.5 additional pages in the proposal template to discuss how their proposal meets all or any of these selection criteria. The TACs will make a recommendation on these to the Directors. The final decision on these allocations will be made by the COO and SUT Directors jointly. They reserve the right not to make an allocation if proposals do not reach a high enough bar.
</p>
<p>
<br>




<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Target of Opportunity (ToO)</div>
</p>
Swinburne scheduled time may now be interrupted by the WMKO ToO
program. Each hour of interrupted ToO time is compensated by 2 hours
of observing time. Please see <a href="STACK_May2019.pdf">
STACK P&P </a> for details. After a call for expressions of interest and careful consideration by the SACK, we are not pursuing ToO triggers in Swinburne call for proposals this semester. 
</p>
<p>
<br>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Instrument Availability</div>
<p>
Refer to <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> webpage for details on all available instruments 
for the 2019B semester. Pay attention to "Special Notes for Semester
2019B" on that webpage as it contains important updates about
telescopes and instruments (e.g., AO-LGS on Keck I unavailable from
Nov-Jan, impacting OSIRIS and NIRSPEC AO observations).
</p>
<p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<br>
Laser Guide Star (LGS) time is now available for both the KI and KII telescopes.  
<br>
Because half nights of laser science combined with non-laser science are almost as 
resource intensive for Keck as whole LGS nights, proposers are encouraged to match half 
night LGS allocations with other LGS allocations.  The STACK will note that the Keck I 
and Keck II lasers will not be scheduled on the same night unless it is for a program 
doing simultaneous observations on both telescopes and the STACK will take care to 
distribute allocated laser nights across the semester to avoid over-burdening the laser 
support team in any given month. 
<br><br>
AO Upgrades:  The new LGS near-IR tip/tilt system on Keck I, TRICK is now available. Refer to <a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/optics/lgsao/lgsbasics.html"> Keck AO page </a> and
  <a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/observing/LGSAO_with_TRICK_or_STRAP"> this document.</a>
</p>
</br>

<br>Submitting a Proposal: </a>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Check your eligibility in the 
<a href="Applicants_PandP_2019.pdf">Applicant Policy and Procedure</a> document.
</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Check instrument availability and latest 
information.  Details of Keck instruments available in 2019B are given 
on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page.  Instrument specifics and relevant 
proposal information can be found on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS slitmasks
are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an <b>Online Cover Sheet</b> and a 
<b>Project Outline</b>.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">KECK ONLINE COVER SHEET</a>
<br>
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available
at the above link.  You will need to create a Keck user account if you
do not already have one.  Please make sure to include ALL collaborators
on this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne.  As part of the cover
sheet, observers are instructed to indicate which observing run dates
during the semester are preferred (P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable
(X) for their programs.  It is to the observer's advantage to be as
liberal as possible in specifying acceptable dates.  A PDF version of the
Keck cover sheet is to be sent with the project outline.  Using your web
browser's print facility, this cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or
postscript and converted to pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project
Outline</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
 href="STACK_proposal_2019Bv2.tex">STACK PROPOSAL FORM</a> <br> All applicants
will need to download the 2019B version of the STACK proposal form
above.  You will need to read the instructions for each section in the
latex file (they are commented out as not to appear on the final
proposal).<br> <b>There have been changes to the instructions for this
semester,</b> and the overall format of the proposal has been
re-ordered.  The full project outline should be written in a minimum
of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  <b>The Scientific
Justification section can be up to a total of 3  pages for text and for
figures, tables and references.</b> A single additional page should be
used for the Technical Justification and Flexibility & Minimum time
sections.  Up to two additional pages can be used for the remaining
sections.  Target lists and the sections Previous STACK Allocation
Outcomes are to be attached to the end of the proposal.  These
attached pages do not count toward the total page count but cannot
include any other information.  Colour images are accepted, however
the image files should not be so large that the proposals cannot be
emailed (i.e., proposals should be less than 1MB in total, but
exceptions can be made).  The project outline must be saved in PDF
format.  <br><br>

<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIlastname_semesterAB_proposalnumber.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Lastname_2019B_W180.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
tecretary (tiantianyuan@swin.edu.au) by the deadline.  The Keck proposal number 
can be found at the top of the Keck Cover Sheet and is issued once you 
fill out and save an initial version of the Cover Sheet.
<br><br>

<strong>(5)</strong> For PIs that have been awarded time in the past, you will
need to describe your outcomes on the Keck Publication Page
<a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/keck_pubs/">here</a>.

</p>

<br>
<!--<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time </strong> (Glenn - do you have any updates on this policy ?)</strong></div>
<p> 
In the interests of promoting collaborative research between Swinburne 
and Caltech, collaborations are to jointly apply to both of their 
respective time allocation committees for Keck time for joint projects 
on an approximately equal time basis. If the proposed joint project is 
not supported by both time allocation committees, the proposed project 
will receive zero nights from either so that no party is disadvantaged 
and each time allocation committee has a clear incentive to support 
their scientists when a genuine desire to collaborate exists.
Caltech will include a summary of Collaborative Time allocations so PIs 
can make collaborative allocations informed by the program history.  The 
link to this summary will be provided here after this semester.
<br><br>
Swinburne and Caltech collaborations will need to apply to the STACK 
following the guidelines described on this webpage and directly to the 
Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals need to be sent to Robert Brucato 
(brucato@astro.caltech.edu) and are due by <strong>18:00 PDT,????</strong>.

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Policy and Procedures</div>
<a name="policies"></a>
<p> Proposal policy and procedures are outlined here:<br>
<img src="http://www.swin.edu.au/images/arrow1.gif" width="14" height="8" alt=""><a href="Applicants_PandP_2019.pdf">Applicant Policy and Procedure document for 2019B</a><br>


<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Outcomes</div>
<p> The STACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and 
in early April to review semester "B" proposals.  The STACK then puts forth 
their recommendations to Caltech.  Proposers will learn of the results 
late-October (semester A) and late-April (semester B).  Approved proposals are not
confirmed until Keck is able to successfully schedule the time (which is not
guaranteed).  The Keck telescope schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) 
and 1 June (semester B).

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping - 
  Fully remote observing is now operational!
<img src="http://www.swin.edu.au/images/arrow1.gif" width="14"
  height="8" alt=""><a
  href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/wiki/index.php?title=Keck_Remote_Control_Room">Keck
  Remote Control Room</a><br>
</div>
<p>Swinburne now has the capability to control the instruments and 
observations at Keck completely remotely from campus (room Luton Lane 2L003), 
i.e., mainland-only observation mode. Duplicate network connections, a 
backup ISDN line, duplicate (mirrored) computers, and an uninterrupted 
power supply are a few of the features added to ensure trouble-free 
observations.  The fully remote capability complements Swinburne's 
long-standing remote eavesdropping mode. For remote observing assistance, please contact
Rob Bassett (rbassett@swin.edu.au)
<br><br>
Those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities for either 
<b>fully remote</b> or <b>eavesdropping</b> mode, must contact Keck's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and Rob Bassett (rbassett@swin.edu.au).  This must be done 4 
weeks in advance of your run for mainland fully remote mode and 2 weeks 
in advance for mainland eavesdropping mode.
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> 
<p> 

<!--After the Keck schedule is released, applications should be made 
to Swinburne Research for financial support via the Access to Major 
Research Facilities Scheme  
<a href="http://www.research.swinburne.edu.au/grants-contracts/funding/internal-grants/amrfs.html">(AMRFS)</a>.
This scheme was made possible from efforts made by Michael Murphy as FICT ADR.</p>

<p>We expect and encourge staff to use the remote facilities, however
funding is available to travel to Keck for exceptional circumstances
(i.e., first time using an instrument, first time to Keck). The
Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty
Research Grant Schemes and the above-mentioned AMRFS funds.  KOS
funding is now integrated into the T7 travel form.  </p> <p>-->
