</p>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Deadline</div> <a 
name="proposal_deadline"></a> <p>All proposals for the 2009B semester must 
be emailed to the STACK technical secretary (Sarah Brough) before 
<strong>March 1st, 2009, midnight AEST</strong>. 
</p>


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div> <a 
name="available_time"></a> <p>We have 7 nights (approximately 30% bright, 
36% grey, 34% dark) available in 2009B (Aug 1 2009 - Jan 31 2010).</p>


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal</div>
<a name="application_procedure"></a>
<p>First check your eligibility in the <a href="procedures.pdf">STACK policies and Procedures</a> document.</p>

<p>A single application should comprise of two parts: The first part, an 
online cover sheet, has to be submitted to the Keck Observatory and is 
available <a 
href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">here</a> (this 
requires you to create a Keck user account). Please make sure to include 
ALL your collaborators in this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne. 
Using your web browser's print facility this cover sheet can be saved as a 
postscript (and converted to pdf using the ps2pdf command) or PDF file.  
The PDF version of the Keck cover sheet should be sent with the second 
part of the proposal: A PDF outline of the project following the headlines 
given in the pro-forma latex file (available <a 
href="STACK_proposal.tex">here</a>) .  The project outline should be no 
more than 4-pages long (including figures and references) with a minimum 
of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  Colour images are accepted, 
however they should not be so large that the files cannot be emailed.  
The 2 PDF files should be combined into 1 file (using macs this can be 
done using the program <a 
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a> 
or dragging and dropping in preview) with naming convention 
PIsurname_semester_instrument.pdf (e.g. Brough_09B_DEIMOS.pdf) and emailed 
to the STACK technical sectretary.</p>

If the application is for a student's thesis, the importance of the
proposed work in the student's thesis should be described clearly in
the proposal.

<p>Observers are instructed to indicate which observing runs during the 
semester are preferred (P) or acceptable (A) for their programs. It is to 
the observer's advantage to be as liberal as possible in specifying 
acceptable runs.</p>

<p class="main_text_black">Details of Keck instruments available in 2009B 
are given in the <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck Instrument Availability</a> page. More detailed information about the various instruments is available in the <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS masks are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p>The schedule will be released early June 2009. As soon as the schedule 
is released, applications should be made to the ANSTO (Australian Nuclear 
Science and Technology Organisation) Access to Major Research Facilities 
Program (<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/AMRFP.html">AMRFP</a>) for 
financial support for your run.</p>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Collaborative Caltech Time</div> <p> We also have access to 5 nights a semester through 
collaborating with researchers at Caltech.  To access this time you need to apply to the Caltech TAC with a Caltech member of staff as PI.  Information 
relating the preparation of those proposals can be found <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tac/obsforms/">here</a>. Their call for 2009B proposals has 
been made soon with deadline 5:00 p.m., Monday, March 30, 2009 Californian time.  This will be 11am Tuesday March 31st for AEST.

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> <p> The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK)
proposes that applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds
should be made by PIs of successful proposals once they have
determined the amount of funding to be available from other sources,
particularly the Faculty Research Committee and AMRFP funds. KOS
applications will be by a simple pro forma (available <a
href="KOS_proposal.tex">here</a>) in which the PI will state their
total costs and the other sources of funds they have pursued. KOS
applications should be sent to the STACK technical secretary. The
technical secretary will check the reasons for the request and pass
any queries to the SACK. The SACK will approve all allocations of KOS
funds. The maximum KOS funding allocated to any given proposal will be
$2200. At the end of each calendar year, residual funds in the Keck
support budget for that year may be distributed retrospectively to
that year's Keck users.</p>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Need Help?</div>
