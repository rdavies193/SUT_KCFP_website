<h1>Call for Keck Proposals 2012B</h1>

<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Deadline</div>
<br>
Proposal submission deadline for the 2012B semester is: &nbsp;
<strong>17:00 March 15, 2012</strong><br>
All proposals must be emailed to the STACK technical secretary, Jeff Cooke at 
&nbsp;<i>jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au</i>&nbsp; in pdf form (see below) <br> before 
<strong>17:00 AEDT</strong> on the deadline date.

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div>
<p>
A total of <strong>9 Keck</strong> nights are available for 2012B 
(Aug 1 2012 - Jan 31 2013).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck &nbsp;I:</strong> &nbsp; 5 nights are 
available with lunation distribution 1 dark, 0 grey, and 4 bright 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck II:</strong> &nbsp; 4 nights are 
available with lunation distribution 1 dark, 0 grey, and 3 bright
<br> 
The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is 
mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be 
decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval.  Any flexibility 
will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with 
much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Instrument Availability</div>
<p>
Specific changes/new items for Semester 2012B:
<br>
<br>
<b> - MOSFIRE</b> will be available as a shared-risk instrument on Keck I for 
semester 2012B.  Because this instrument has neither been installed nor tested, 
this unprecedented availability will require the STACK to provide Caltech/Keck with 
a HIRES or LRIS backup program along with their allocations for any MOSFIRE 
time. The HIRES or LRIS back-up programs will be matched to the MOSFIRE allocations
but will require the usual sky brightness and lunation considerations.
<br>
<b> - OSIRIS</b> is classified as a Keck I shared-risk instrument for 2012B 
because it has not yet been tested on-sky with, or without, the Keck I 
laser.  
<br>
<b> - The Keck Interferometer</b> will not be offered this semester.  
<br>
<br>
Refer to <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> webpage for details on these, and all available instruments 
for the 2013A semester (this page will be updated soon).
</p>

<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<br>
Laser Guide Star (LGS) time is now available for both the KI and KII telescopes.  
The restriction on the number of available LGS nights has been lifted.  Keck would like 
scientific demand from all institutions to determine both the number of nights and the 
distribution of nights between Keck I and Keck II. 
<br><br>
Because half nights of laser science combined with non-laser science are almost as 
resource intensive for Keck as whole LGS nights, proposers are encouraged to match half 
night LGS allocations with other LGS allocations.  The STACK will note that the Keck I 
and Keck II lasers will not be scheduled on the same night unless it is for a program 
doing simultaneous observations on both telescopes and the STACK will take care to 
distribute allocated laser nights across the semester to avoid over-burdening the laser 
support team in any given month. 
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal</div> <a
name="application_procedure"></a>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Check your eligibility in the 
<a href="procedures.pdf">STACK policies and Procedures</a> document.
</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Check instrument availability and latest 
information.  Details of Keck instruments available in 2013A are given 
on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page.  Instrument specifics and relevant 
proposal information can be found on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS slitmasks
are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an online cover sheet and project 
outline.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet - </strong> 
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available 
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">here</a>
(this requires you to create a Keck user account). Please make sure to
include ALL your collaborators on this cover sheet, not just those
from Swinburne.  As part of the cover sheet, observers are instructed 
to indicate which observing run dates during the semester are preferred 
(P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable (X) for their programs. It is to
the observer's advantage to be as liberal as possible in specifying
acceptable runs.  A PDF version of the Keck cover sheet is to be sent 
with the project outline.  Using your web browser's print facility, this 
cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or postscript and converted to 
pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project Outline - </strong>
A project outline (the proposal) must be submitted following the headlines 
given in the pro-forma latex file available <a href="STACK_proposal.tex">here</a>. 
The project outline should be no more than 6-pages (including figures 
and references) with a minimum of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  
The Scientific Justification section can be up to a total of three pages 
including all figures, tables and references.  A single additional page 
should be used for the Technical Justification and Flexibility & Minimum 
time sections and for the Target list.  Up to two additional pages can be 
used for the remaining items (and long target lists).  Colour images are 
accepted, however they should not be so large that the files cannot be 
emailed.  The project outline must be saved in PDF format. 
<br><br>
<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIsurname_semester_instrument.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Kacprzak_13A_DEIMOS.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
secretary (jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au) by the deadline.
</p>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time</div>
<p> Swinburne researchers also have access to 5 nights a semester via
collaboration with researchers at Caltech.  To access this time, the
Caltech staff member must be the PI of the proposal and you will need
to apply directly to the Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit/2013A/Call2013A.html">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals are due by <strong>17:00 PDT, October 1, 2012</strong>.
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Policy and Procedures</div>
<a name="policies"></a>
<p> Proposal policy and procedures are outlined in this document.<br>
<img src="http://www.swin.edu.au/images/arrow1.gif" width="14" height="8" alt=""><a href="procedures.pdf">STACK policies and Procedures</a><br>
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Outcomes</div>
<p> The STACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and 
in early April to review semester "B" proposals.  The STACK then puts forth 
their recommendations to Caltech.  Proposers will learn of the results 
late-October (semester A) and late-April (semester B).  The Keck telescope 
schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) and 1 June (semester B).
</p>
<hr />

<!-- As soon as the schedule is released, applications should be made to the 
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) Access 
to Major Research Facilities Program 
(<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>)
for financial support.
</p>
-->

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping</div>
<p>For those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities in 
"eavesdropping" mode, you must contact WMKO's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and Jeff Cooke in advance of your
run (4 weeks for mainland-only observing, 2 weeks for mainland
eavesdropping mode). Currently, fully-remote (mainland-only) 
observing is not available but may be in the near future. 
</p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> 
<p> 

<!--
As mentioned above, as soon as the Keck schedule is released, 
applications should be made to the ANSTO 
<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>
for financial support.</p>
-->
<p>The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that 
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by 
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of 
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty 
Research Committee and AMRFP funds. After expenses have been acquitted, 
KOS applications can be submitted using <a href="KOSclaim.docx">this form</a> 
in which the PI will state their total costs and the other sources of 
funds they have pursued. KOS applications should be sent to the STACK 
technical secretary <b> after</b> the expenses have been incurred.  The 
technical secretary will check the reasons for the request and pass any 
queries to the SACK. The SACK will approve all allocations of KOS funds. 
The maximum KOS funding allocated to any given proposal will be $2200. 
At the end of each calendar year, residual funds in the Keck support 
budget for that year may be distributed retrospectively to that year's 
Keck users.
