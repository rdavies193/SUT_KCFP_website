<h1>Call for Keck Proposals 2012A</h1>
<br>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Deadline</div> <a 
name="proposal_deadline"></a> <p>Proposal submission deadline for the 
2012A semester is &nbsp;<b>17:00 AEST, 19 September, 2011</b>. &nbsp;
All proposals must be emailed to the STACK technical secretary, Jeff Cooke at 
&nbsp;<i>jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au</i>&nbsp; in pdf form (see below) before 
<strong>17:00 AEST</strong> on the deadline date.

</p>
<p> Previous semester proposals are located at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<br>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div> 
<p> A total of <strong>8 Keck</strong> nights are available for 2012A 
(Feb 1 2012 - Jul 31 2012).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck &nbsp;I:</strong> &nbsp; 4 nights are 
available with lunation distribution 1 dark, 0 grey, and 3 bright 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck II:</strong> &nbsp; 4 nights are 
available with lunation distribution 2 dark, 0 grey, and 2 bright
<br> 
The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is 
mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be 
decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval.  Any flexibility 
will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with 
much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.

<!--
Note for this semester: As part of our agreement with Caltech, it is 
expected that the STACK nights are to be spread evenly over both 
semesters, lunation, and telescopes.  The KI/KII night distribution is 
uneven for this semester.  This is a result of the use of a 6 semester 
moving window to determine the KI/KII night distribution and an uneven 
allocation in the 2009A semester.  In order to prevent such imbalances 
to propagate to future semesters, Caltech has reviewed the distribution 
history and approach and has suggested a plan that would assure a more 
balanced KI/KII night distributions in the future.
-->
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<p> For semester 2012A, we have <b>2 nights</b> of guaranteed Laser Guide 
Star (LGS) time.  LGS time is now available for both the KI and KII 
telescopes.  Refer to the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> webpage for details.
Applicants may apply for more than 2 nights of LGS observations, 
and more than 2 proposals requesting LGS use may be approved by the STACK and 
forwarded to Caltech for consideration/scheduling.  However, if the combined 
Caltech+Swinburne+Yale LGS request exceeds Caltech's total allowance for 2012A, 
Caltech may not grant Swinburne the additional LGS time (or may grant fewer LGS 
nights than Swinburne requests, with the minimum being the guaranteed 2 LGS 
nights).  The STACK will form contingency plans for this eventuality.  
Therefore, proposals for LGS time must include complete, detailed justification 
of the science achievable in each LGS night.  This justification should be 
included in the "FLEXIBILITY & MINIMUM TIME" section of the proposal form.

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal</div> <a
name="application_procedure"></a>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Check your eligibility in the 
<a href="procedures.pdf">STACK policies and Procedures</a> document.
</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Check instrument availability and latest 
information.  Details of Keck instruments available in 2012A are given 
on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page.  Instrument specifics and relevant 
proposal information can be found on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.  For example, LRIS and DEIMOS masks
are due at least 4 weeks prior to the observations.
</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an online cover sheet and project 
outline.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet - </strong> 
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available 
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php">here</a>
(this requires you to create a Keck user account). Please make sure to
include ALL your collaborators on this cover sheet, not just those
from Swinburne.  As part of the cover sheet, observers are instructed 
to indicate which observing run dates during the semester are preferred 
(P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable (X) for their programs. It is to
the observer's advantage to be as liberal as possible in specifying
acceptable runs.  A PDF version of the Keck cover sheet is to be sent 
with the project outline.  Using your web browser's print facility, this 
cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or postscript and converted to 
pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project Outline - </strong>
A project outline (the proposal) must be submitted following the headlines 
given in the pro-forma latex file available <a href="STACK_proposal.tex">here</a>. 
The project outline should be no more than 6-pages (including figures 
and references) with a minimum of 12pt font as detailed in the pro-forma.  
The Scientific Justification section can be up to a total of three pages 
including all figures, tables and references.  A single additional page 
should be used for the Technical Justification and Flexibility & Minimum 
time sections and for the Target list.  Up to two additional pages can be 
used for the remaining items (and long target lists).  Colour images are 
accepted, however they should not be so large that the files cannot be 
emailed.  The project outline must be saved in PDF format. 
<br><br>
<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml">combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIsurname_semester_instrument.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Kacprzak_12A_DEIMOS.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
secretary (jcooke@astro.swin.edu.au) by the deadline.
</p>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time</div>
<p> Swinburne researchers also have access to 5 nights a semester via
collaboration with researchers at Caltech.  To access this time, the
Caltech staff member must be the PI of the proposal and you will need
to apply directly to the Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit/2012A/Call2012A.html">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals are due by <strong>17:00 PDT, Wednesday
28 September 2011</strong>
</p>

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Policy and Procedures</div>
<a name="policies"></a>
<p> Proposal policy and procedures are outlined in this document.<br>

<hr />
<p><strong>The 2012A schedule will be released on 1 December 2011.</strong><br> 

<!-- As soon as the schedule is released, applications should be made to the 
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) Access 
to Major Research Facilities Program 
(<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>)
for financial support.
</p>
-->

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping</div>
<p>For those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities in 
"eavesdropping" mode, you must contact WMKO's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html">
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and Jeff Cooke in advance of your
run (4 weeks for mainland-only observing, 2 weeks for mainland
eavesdropping mode). Currently, fully-remote (mainland-only) 
observing is not available. 
</p>


<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> 
<p> 

<!--
As mentioned above, as soon as the Keck schedule is released, 
applications should be made to the ANSTO 
<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/research/user_access/amrfp">AMRFP</a>
for financial support.</p>
-->
<p>The Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that 
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by 
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of 
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty 
Research Committee and AMRFP funds. KOS applications will be by a simple 
pro-forma (available <a href="KOSclaim.docx">here</a>) in which the PI 
will state their total costs and the other sources of funds they have 
pursued. KOS applications should be sent to the STACK technical secretary. 
The technical secretary will check the reasons for the request and pass
any queries to the SACK. The SACK will approve all allocations of KOS
funds. The maximum KOS funding allocated to any given proposal will be
$2200. At the end of each calendar year, residual funds in the Keck
support budget for that year may be distributed retrospectively to
that year's Keck users.
