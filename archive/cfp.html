<h1>Call for Keck Proposals 2021B</h1>

<p>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Due Time</div>
<br>
Proposal submission deadline for the 2021B semester is: 
<strong>March 29th 2021 (AEST) </strong><br>
All proposals must be emailed to the STACK technical secretary at <A HREF="mailto:KeckTS@swin.edu.au">KeckTS@swin.edu.au</A> in pdf form (see below) <br> before <strong>17:00 AEST</strong> on the deadline date.<br>
</p>

<strong>The primary role of the Swinburne Time Allocation Committee
for Keck (STACK) is to ensure the maximum
scientific outcomes for Swinburne from time on the Keck telescopes.</strong>
See here  <a href="STACK_Feb2021.pdf" target="_blank"  >
STACK P&P </a> for details.
<br>
<p>
General information about applying for Keck time can be found on the Keck Observatory Website 
<a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/observing/apply.html" target="_blank" >here</a>.
This is the Keck website that includes people to contact if you have
questions, forms, observing considerations, and information for Keck
proposals for other institutions.
</p>

<hr />
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Available Time</div>
<p>
A total of <strong>5 Keck</strong> nights are available for 2021B
(August 1, 2021 - January 31, 2022) .<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck &nbsp;I:</strong> &nbsp; <b>3</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>1 dark, 1 grey, 1 bright</b> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keck II:</strong> &nbsp; <b>2</b> nights are 
available with lunation distribution <b>1 dark, 0 grey, 1 bright</b>
<br><br>
The number of nights on each telescope and lunation distribution is 
mostly fixed, however there may be some flexibility and this will be 
decided by the STACK and sent to Caltech for approval.  Any flexibility 
will be mainly in the lunation distribution on each telescope, with 
much less flexibility, if any, in the number of nights on each telescope.
</p>
<br>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">COVID-19 impacts</div>
<p>
Due to the likely continued impacts on the observatory and the observing community by COVID-19:
<br><br>
- WMKO is advising proposers that there may be currently unforeseen impacts on their ability to execute the allocated schedule.  In particular, specialty modes (e.g. PyWFS, ESI IFU, VV coronagraphs) may be unavailable for operation.
<br><br>
- Some instruments and modes of instruments like NIRSPAO and ESI may be scheduled in limited blocks or campaigns to minimize load on support crews.
<br><br>
- In order to reduce the support load on observatory staff, partial night allocations may be limited.  Proposers should consider whether full night allocations can meet their science goals.
 <b>Please see <a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html" target="_blank" >here</a> for more details.</b>
</p>

<p>
Also note that depending on the situation in Victoria, work permits may be required to be able to observe on campus. Please make sure you allow adequate time to apply for work permits or special permissions when required. 
<br><br>

There is also an option for At-Home (pajama mode) Observing: 
<br><br>
- Keck will support up to two observers for at home observing: one primary and one secondary observer.  Those two individuals may help other team members get set up, but Keck support will be limited for additional observers.
<br><br>
- At home observing requires the installation of software which only runs on linux and macOS operating systems. 
<br><br>
- Observers using at home observing should plan to work with Keck staff to install and test the software several days ahead of their run to allow time for troubleshooting.
</p>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT)</div>
</p>
In accordance with the Caltech and Swinburne collaborative agreement for Keck, the COO and SUT Directors have agreed to set aside, between them, 1-2 nights each semester from their Director’s allocation to support highly ranked CIT-SUT collaborative proposals. These proposals should seek to develop new and innovative scientific collaborations esp. those with long term strategic potential to have high scientific impact and/or increase the research capabilities of each organisation. The following additional selection criteria will be used for evaluation:
<br>
</p>
(1) High-risk high-reward pilot proposals for new science <br>
(2) pilot for strategic collaborative project <br>
(3) significant ongoing collaboration potential <br>
(4) evidence of existing significant ongoing collaboration <br>
 </p>
Applicants may use up to 0.5 additional pages in the proposal template to discuss how their proposal meets all or any of these selection criteria. The TACs will make a recommendation on these to the Directors. The final decision on these allocations will be made by the COO and SUT Directors jointly. They reserve the right not to make an allocation if proposals do not reach a high enough bar.
</p>

<p>
Please read the <a href="P&P2021.pdf" target="_blank"  >Applicant Policy and Procedure</a> for more details and contact the Technical Secretery if you require any further clarifications on the DDT process.
</p>

<p>
<br>




<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Target of Opportunity (ToO)</div>
</p>
Swinburne scheduled time may now be interrupted by the WMKO ToO
program. Each hour of interrupted ToO time is compensated by 2 hours
of observing time. Please see <a href="STACK_Feb2021.pdf" target="_blank"  >
STACK P&P </a> for details. </p>
<p>
<br>

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Instrument Availability</div>
<p>
Refer to <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html" target="_blank"  >Keck
Instrument Availability</a> webpage for details on all available instruments 
for the 2021B semester. Pay attention to "Special Notes for Semester
2021B" on that webpage as it contains important updates about
telescopes and instruments.
</p>
<p>
<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Laser Guide Star Observations</div>
<br>
Laser Guide Star (LGS) time is now available for both the KI and KII telescopes.  
<br>
Because half nights of laser science combined with non-laser science are almost as 
resource intensive for Keck as whole LGS nights, proposers are encouraged to match half 
night LGS allocations with other LGS allocations.  The STACK will note that the Keck I 
and Keck II lasers will not be scheduled on the same night unless it is for a program 
doing simultaneous observations on both telescopes and the STACK will take care to 
distribute allocated laser nights across the semester to avoid over-burdening the laser 
support team in any given month. 
<br><br>
AO Upgrades:  The new LGS near-IR tip/tilt system on Keck I, TRICK is now available. Refer to <a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/optics/lgsao/lgsbasics.html" target="_blank"  > Keck AO page </a> and

<hr />


<br><strong>Submitting a Proposal:</strong> </a>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Check your eligibility in the 
<a href="P&P2021.pdf" target="_blank"  >Applicant Policy and Procedure</a> document.
</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Check instrument availability and latest 
information.  Details of Keck instruments available in 2021B are given 
on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/observing/instavail.html" target="_blank">Keck
Instrument Availability</a> page.  Instrument specifics and relevant 
proposal information can be found on the <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/inst/index.php" target="_blank">Keck
Instruments & Facilties</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Prepare your proposal application.  A single 
application has two components - an <b>Online Cover Sheet</b> and a 
<b>Project Outline</b>.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Cover Sheet</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/PILogin/login.php" target="_blank"  >KECK ONLINE COVER SHEET</a>
<br>
The Keck Observatory requires an online cover sheet that is available
at the above link.  You will need to create a Keck user account if you
do not already have one.  Please make sure to include ALL collaborators
on this cover sheet, not just those from Swinburne.  As part of the cover
sheet, observers are instructed to indicate which observing run dates
during the semester are preferred (P), acceptable (A), or not acceptable
(X) for their programs.  It is to the observer's advantage to be as
liberal as possible in specifying acceptable dates.  A PDF version of the
Keck cover sheet is to be sent with the project outline.  Using your web
browser's print facility, this cover sheet can be saved as a PDF file or
postscript and converted to pdf using the UNIX ps2pdf command.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Project
Outline</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
 href="STACK_proposal_2021B.tex" target="_blank" >STACK PROPOSAL FORM</a> <br> All applicants
will need to download the 2021B version of the STACK proposal form
above. Instructions and page limits are included as comments in the proposal.
Additionally, you can use the version in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/yhsxkwcfxywr" target="_blank" >Overleaf </a>.
Use instructions <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Copying_a_project#Making_a_copy_of_a_project" target="_blank">here</a> to copy the overleaf project.
<br><br>

<strong>(4)</strong> Combine the two PDF files into one file.  This can be 
done in a variety of ways such as using the program <a
href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml" target="_blank"  >combinepdfs</a>
or dragging and dropping in preview for Macs or by using the UNIX pdfmerge
command.  Proposals must use the naming convention
<strong>PIlastname_semesterAB_proposalnumber.pdf</strong> 
(e.g. Lastname_2021B_W180.pdf) and emailed to the STACK technical 
tecretary <A HREF="mailto:KeckTS@swin.edu.au">KeckTS@swin.edu.au</A> by the deadline with the email subject heading <strong>PIlastname_semesterAB_proposalnumber</strong>.  The Keck proposal number 
can be found at the top of the Keck Cover Sheet and is issued once you 
fill out and save an initial version of the Cover Sheet.
<br><br>

<strong>(5)</strong> For PIs that have been awarded time in the past, you will
need to describe your outcomes on the Keck Publication Page
<a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/keck_pubs/" target="_blank"   >here</a>.

</p>

<br>
<!--<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Submitting a Proposal for Caltech
Collaborative Time </strong> (Glenn - do you have any updates on this policy ?)</strong></div>
<p> 
In the interests of promoting collaborative research between Swinburne 
and Caltech, collaborations are to jointly apply to both of their 
respective time allocation committees for Keck time for joint projects 
on an approximately equal time basis. If the proposed joint project is 
not supported by both time allocation committees, the proposed project 
will receive zero nights from either so that no party is disadvantaged 
and each time allocation committee has a clear incentive to support 
their scientists when a genuine desire to collaborate exists.
Caltech will include a summary of Collaborative Time allocations so PIs 
can make collaborative allocations informed by the program history.  The 
link to this summary will be provided here after this semester.
<br><br>
Swinburne and Caltech collaborations will need to apply to the STACK 
following the guidelines described on this webpage and directly to the 
Caltech TAC
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/coo/solicit">here</a>.
Caltech Collaborative time proposals need to be sent to Robert Brucato 
(brucato@astro.caltech.edu) and are due by <strong>18:00 PDT,????</strong>.

<br>
<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Proposal Outcomes</div>
<p> The STACK will meet in early October to review semester "A" proposals and 
in early April to review semester "B" proposals.  The STACK then puts forth 
their recommendations to Caltech.  Proposers will learn of the results 
late-October (semester A) and late-April (semester B).  Approved proposals are not
confirmed until Keck is able to successfully schedule the time (which is not
guaranteed).  The Keck telescope schedule is released on 1 December (semester A) 
and 1 June (semester B).

<div class="main_title_dkgrey">Remote Observing/Eavesdropping - 
  Fully remote observing is now operational!
<img src="http://www.swin.edu.au/images/arrow1.gif" width="14"
  height="8" alt=""><a
  href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/wiki/index.php?title=Keck_Remote_Control_Room" target="_blank">Keck
  Remote Control Room</a><br>
</div>
<p>Swinburne now has the capability to control the instruments and 
observations at Keck completely remotely from campus (room Luton Lane 2L003), 
i.e., mainland-only observation mode. Duplicate network connections, a 
backup ISDN line, duplicate (mirrored) computers, and an uninterrupted 
power supply are a few of the features added to ensure trouble-free 
observations.  The fully remote capability complements Swinburne's 
long-standing remote eavesdropping mode. For remote observing assistance, please contact  <A HREF=https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/staff/mgirard.html target="_blank" >Marianne Girard</A> at <A HREF="mailto:mgirard@swin.edu.au">mgirard@swin.edu.au</A>
<br><br>
Those who wish to use the Swinburne remote facilities for either 
<b>fully remote</b> or <b>eavesdropping</b> mode, must contact Keck's <a
href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/mainland_observing.html" target="_blank" >
Mainland Observing Coordinators</a> and <A HREF=https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/staff/mgirard.html target="_blank" >Marianne Girard</A> at <A HREF="mailto:mgirard@swin.edu.au">mgirard@swin.edu.au</A>.  This must be done 4 
weeks in advance of your run for mainland fully remote mode and 2 weeks 
in advance for mainland eavesdropping mode.
</p>
<br>
 <div class="main_title_dkgrey">Financial Assistance</div> <a
name="kos"></a> 
<p>
We expect and encourage staff to use the remote facilities, however
funding is available to travel to Keck for exceptional circumstances
(i.e., first time using an instrument, first time to Keck). The
Swinburne Advisory Committee for Keck (SACK) proposes that
applications for Keck Observing Support (KOS) funds should be made by
PIs of successful proposals once they have determined the amount of
funding to be available from other sources, particularly the Faculty
Research Grant Schemes and other ARC sources.  Please contact
the Deputy Director for funding requests.
